					What About Sparring?
				</div>

				<p className="mb-6 text-gray-100">
					At <span className="font-semibold">YGK Boxing</span>, sparring is{' '}
					<span className="font-semibold">not required</span>—but we do offer a
					clear path for kids who express an interest in it.
				</p>

				<p className="mb-6 text-gray-100">
					We only allow kids to begin sparring when they are truly ready—which
					means:
				</p>

				<ul className="mb-6 list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-100">
					<li>They have been training consistently</li>
					<li>They demonstrate a strong understanding of the fundamentals</li>
					<li>
						They have shown that they listen to their coaches and respect the
						rules of the gym
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p className="mb-6 text-gray-100">
					Every child progresses at their own pace. Some may pick things up
					quickly and be encouraged to start light sparring, while others may
					need more time to develop confidence and skills.
				</p>

				<p className="mb-6 text-gray-100">
					No child is rushed—our coaches will work closely with each individual
					to ensure they’re prepared both mentally and physically before
					stepping into sparring.
				</p>

				<p className="font-semibold text-gray-100">
					The safety, confidence, and well-being of our young boxers always come
					first.
