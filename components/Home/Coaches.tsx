      "Finley is Coach JD's Diabetic Alert Dog from Dog Guides Canada and wears her red vest when she is working with JD to alert him before a possible hypo or hyper glycemic reaction. When Finley is wearing her red vest she knows that it is work and has to avoid human interaction, playing, petting, and distractions. Missing a low blood sugar could result in an emergency situation. After work she is a regular playful dog who enjoys playing fetch and going on long walks.\n" +

Dog Guides is a charitable program helping people with disabilities lead safer and more independent lives.
